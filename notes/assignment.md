Exercises
The goal of the lab is to put in a rep doing everything that you did during the Express - Routers & Controllers lesson:

Be sure to create an array of “fake” data representing some of your awesome developer skills. The specific properties describing a skill object is up to you!

Implement index functionality for the skills resource

Implement show functionality for the skills resource

Hints
Keep the data resource name short and simple - something like skills.

Following best-practice routing and MVC will result in the following modules for the skills resource:
routes/skills.js
models/skill.js
views/skills
controllers/skills.js
Use RESTful routes
Bonuses
Use EJS partial views to make your templates more DRY (see link in Reference section of the lesson) and/or this link.

Add styling or use a CSS framework to make the app look better :)

This lab combined with Part 2, which builds upon this lab, is a deliverable. Please submit the URL of your express-dev-skills GH repo as directed.
